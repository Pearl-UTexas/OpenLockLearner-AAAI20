# OpenLock Learner

This repo contains the code for the agents in the AAAI 2020 Oral paper "Theory-based Causal Transfer: Integrating Instance-level Induction and Abstract-level Structure Learning." 

It provides various agents to use with the OpenLock OpenAI Gym environment [https://github.com/mjedmonds/OpenLock](https://github.com/mjedmonds/OpenLock)

You'll need to bring in the OpenLock repo into your `PYTHONPATH` for this repo. If you are using a virtualenv, you can add `export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/OpenLock"` to `/bin/activate`. Alternatively, you can `python setup.py install` OpenLock to add it as a package to your python environment.
